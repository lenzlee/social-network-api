Bootcamp Module 18: NoSQL Challenge - Social Network API

## NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API
In this project, we were asked to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. We used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, we also used a JavaScript date library or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
